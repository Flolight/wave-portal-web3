# Wave portal project

This project is a workshop from [buildspace.so](https://buildspace.so/).
The goal is to learn some Solidity, write + deploy a smart contract to the blockchain, and build a Web3 client app to interact with the contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat help

npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```
